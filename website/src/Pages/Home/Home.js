                            Welcome to  <strong>Star Professors: Student-Made for YorkU!</strong> With this app, you can organize course sections by
                            the rating of the professors that teach them. It's important to consider a lot more than just ratings when taking a courseâ€”
                            but a professor's ability to teach has a measurable impact on student performance.

                            Through web-scraping, data is collected from <strong>RateMyProf</strong> on all available professors at York University. This is then collated with
                            known schedule data for a given course to determine the highest rated professors and rank them accordingly.

                            Don't use this as the sole determinant for how you schedule your classes. A rating from RateMyProf can
                            <i> sometimes</i> give you an idea of a professor's aptitude, but not all ratings on the site are made equal.
                            RateMyProf is a <i>very easily</i> manipulated site and the data is to be taken with several grains of salt.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This app also only gives a sample of the <i>average</i> ratings of a professor. People change, professors are people.
                            A professor may have bad ratings from 10 years ago but great ones in the last 3 years. Always do your due diligence when
                            analyzing data to make sure that you are reading it with the correct context.
